## CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch
Language models serve as the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) applications and open up a new paradigm of having a single general purpose system address a range of downstream tasks. As the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and NLP continues to grow, possessing a deep understanding of language models becomes essential for scientists and engineers alike. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of language models by walking them through the entire process of developing their own. Drawing inspiration from operating systems courses that create an entire operating system from scratch, we will lead students through every aspect of language model creation, including data collection and cleansing for pre-training, transformer model construction, model training, and evaluation before deployment.

## CS324: Language Models
The field of natural language processing (NLP) has been transformed by massive pre-trained language models. They form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems across a wide range of tasks and have shown an impressive ability to generate fluent text and perform few-shot learning. At the same time, these models are hard to understand and give rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals about the modeling, theory, ethics, and systems aspects of large language models, as well as gain hands-on experience working with them.
